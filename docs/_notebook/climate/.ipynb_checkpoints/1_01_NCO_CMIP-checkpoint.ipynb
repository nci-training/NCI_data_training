    "\n",
    "The netCDF Operators (NCO) comprise about a dozen standalone, command-line programs that take netCDF, HDF, and/or DAP files as input, then operate (e.g., derive new fields, compute statistics, print, hyperslab, manipulate metadata, regrid) and output the results to screen or files in text, binary, or netCDF formats. NCO aids analysis of gridded and unstructured scientific data. The shell-command style of NCO allows users to manipulate and analyze files interactively, or with expressive scripts that avoid some overhead of higher-level programming environments."
